Robot Joint – Onshape Design

# **Robot Joint – Onshape Design**

## **Overview**

This project features a **robot joint** designed using **Onshape CAD**.
The part acts as a connector between robotic arm segments, allowing secure attachment while maintaining mobility. The design includes a circular base with mounting holes and a curved support arm for structural strength.

## **Features**

* **Robotic Arm Joint**: Designed to connect two robot arm segments.
* **Mounting Holes**: Multiple evenly spaced holes for bolts or screws.
* **Curved Support Arm**: Improves structural stability and reduces material stress.
* **Filleted Edges**: Prevents sharp edges for safer handling.
* **Parametric Design**: Easily modifiable for different robot sizes.

## **Tools Used**

* **Onshape CAD**: Cloud-based parametric modeling.
* **Extrude & Cut Features**: To create the main body and precise holes.
* **Fillet Tool**: For smooth edge finishing.

## **Applications**

* Robotic arm movement and articulation.
* Mechanical linkages in automation systems.
* Custom robotics projects.

## **How to Open**

1. Open **Onshape** in your browser.
2. Import the provided file or use the shared document link.
3. View and edit the model in **Part Studio**.
